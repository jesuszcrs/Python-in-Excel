# Motivation
As a team in our company, we used to spend considerable time manually processing vendor requests for data backup details. With approximately 30 emails received daily and around 120 emails weekly, this task was time-consuming and prone to errors.

The Vendor Detail Tool was created to automate this process, significantly reducing the time required to verify information and respond to vendor inquiries. What used to take 15 minutes manually can now be accomplished in less than 3 minutes using the GUI interface provided by Vendor_Detail_Tool.py
